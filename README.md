# Map-Project

## Description
Travel the globe from your desk.

## Background
Bored? Too lazy to move? Love travelling? This is the solution.

## Features
- Drag to spin the globe.
- Click to see a streetview.

## Development
Down to Earth is built in JavaScript. It's a one page app that we wrapped in Node.js so we could deploy it to Heroku. 

The globe is animated using WebGL Earth (http://www.webglearth.org/api). We pass the coordinates from a click on the globe to Google Maps to render a map and the closest streeetview.
